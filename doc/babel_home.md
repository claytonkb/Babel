Why You Should Use Babel
========================

Babel is a general-purpose programming language that has been designed from the ground up for the future of computing. What is the future of computing?

* **International** - the Internet has spread computing to [every corner of the globe](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/Internet_users_by_country_world_map.png). Babel natively supports UTF-8, allowing non-English speakers to write Babel code with the same ease as English speakers.  

* **Cross-platform** - Babel can run on any platform with a compiler that supports the [C99 standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99).  

* **Mobile** - the Babel core is tiny, less than 200KB, and can run in as little as 256KB of RAM. Babel is a high-performance language, reducing power consumption. Babel also has built-in support for memory and file compression.  

* **Online Mass Storage** - the Internet enables us to access the same user experience from our desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile phones - why can't we access this same user experience for our private data? Babel has built-in support for encryption, making it easy to support secure online mass-storage of private data.  

* **Active Web** - Babel 1.0 has built-in crypto-based code authentication to enforce a white-list execution model for safer remote-code execution.  

* **User Library Based** - Many of the problems that users need to solve are simple and easy to code, it just requires someone to take the time to sit down and write it. The active Web will enable greater proliferation of user-library based computing. Babel's support for the active Web will be able to foster a broad base of user libraries.  

* **Resource-Conscious** - We have reached [the end of the famed "Moore's Law"](http://www.cnet.com/news/end-of-moores-law-its-not-just-about-physics/). Time, power (battery life) and memory are increasingly dominant constraints on computing. Users' concerns about everything from air pollution to battery life means that they require software that runs quietly and efficiently. Every Babel program runs in a Babel Virtual Machine which has finite, adjustable time and memory constraints. This enables computing even in highly resource constrained environments like embedded systems and mobile platforms.  

* **Garbage-Collected** - Babel uses a [stop-and-copy garbage-collector](http://www.memorymanagement.org/glossary/c.html#copying.garbage.collection). This relieves the programmer of having to worry about which of his objects are currently live. Thanks to the uniform data-structure used in Babel, the garbage-collector is extremely fast and lightweight.  

* **Rapidly-Prototyped** - Babel provides a fully integrated REPL debugging interface, as well as built-in support for "quick-and-dirty" I/O to get your project moving as quickly as possible.  

We encourage you to give Babel a try. If you have any questions or would like support in compiling Babel on a new platform, please [contact us](babel_contact.html).
